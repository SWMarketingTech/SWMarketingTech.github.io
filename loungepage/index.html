I believe that for many users, this will confuse them and cause them to lose interest. My goal was to take the pictorial approach.</p>

I felt that the first set of questions in the example had way too many questions and that it could possibly be a tad bit overwhelming for someone to gloss through if they were just swiping through suitors. I felt the best option was to condense the questions into a smaller number of Q&A questions that had a more intimate approach. So instead of asking some to select "yes" or "no" for whether or not they like long walks on the beach, they would see a prompt asking them if they like long walks on the beach, and they would answer in their own words. This is an app on a phone, not an actual face to face encounter, so I wanted to bridge the gap as much as possible to create supplicate human-like interaction.</p>
